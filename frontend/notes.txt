    For configuring Icons for Web and IOS this is the package I used for Icons https://www.npmjs.com/package/react-native-vector-icons

    #IGNORE THESE LINE
    #Also note that for getting the fonts working on android I modified the android/app/build.gradle
    #*** THIS LINE
    #apply from: "../../node_modules/react-native-vector-icons/fonts.gradle"
    #***
    
    For Icons I used this https://ionic.io/ionicons/

    Also here are the hexcodes for the colors we are using     

    White: #FFFFFF 
    Rich Black: #03312E 
    Feldgrau: #3E6259 
    Xanadu: #6A7B76 
    Artichoke: #8B9D83
